# Rain-and-Fog-Automatic-car-wiper

The automatic car wiper system is a crucial component in modern vehicles, enhancing driving safety and convenience. However, traditional wiper systems often require manual adjustments, leading to inconveniences and inefficiencies, particularly during sudden changes in weather conditions. To overcome these challenges, we have developed a rain and fog sensing automatic car wiper system using an Arduino microcontroller, rain sensor, DHT11 humidity sensor, and servo motor. This system detects rain and fog conditions and adjusts the wiper speed accordingly, providing drivers with a more efficient and hassle-free solution.

Design and Implementation:

The automatic car wiper system utilizes the Arduino microcontroller as the central control unit. It interfaces with a rain sensor to detect the presence of rain and a DHT11 humidity sensor to measure the humidity level, indicating potential foggy conditions. Based on the sensor readings, the system adjusts the speed of the servo motor connected to the car wiper mechanism.

The design and implementation details, including the circuit diagram, connections, and code instructions, are provided in the report documentation of this repository. Please refer to the documentation for step-by-step instructions on setting up and deploying the automatic car wiper system.
